> We propose DiNAT-IR, a novel image restoration Transformer that builds upon dilated neighborhood attention. It balances local and global context via multi-dilated windowed attention, and introduces a channel-aware module to overcome the locality bottleneck. DiNAT-IR achieves competitive performance across diverse low-level tasks, including motion deblurring, defocus deblurring, denoising, and deraining.
